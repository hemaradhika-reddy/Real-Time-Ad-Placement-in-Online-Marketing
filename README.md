# Real-Time Ad Placement in Online Marketing Using DRL 🚀📈🎯  

## 🌟 Project Overview  
In the digital age, **online marketing** has become indispensable for businesses seeking to engage users effectively. This project leverages **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** to revolutionize **real-time ad placement**. By dynamically adapting to user behaviors, preferences, and browsing contexts, it enhances **click-through rates (CTR)**, user engagement, and revenue generation.  


## 🛠️ Key Features  
✨ **Dynamic Ad Placement**: Simulates a responsive environment that adapts to user preferences in real time.  
✨ **Advanced DRL Agents**: Includes **DQN**, **A2C**, and **PPO**, each optimized for unique challenges.  
✨ **Custom Metrics**: Tracks **CTR**, conversion rates, cumulative rewards, and user engagement.  
✨ **Reward System**: Implements feedback-driven learning to continuously refine ad strategies.
